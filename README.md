## Synopsis

**DineHub** is a deliberately vulnerable online food ordering platform designed to simulate real-world web vulnerabilities with realistic protections and bypass requirements.  
The platform allows users to register, browse restaurants, place orders, leave reviews, and manage payments. Each vulnerability is intentionally implemented with partial security controls, requiring bypass techniques such as encoding tricks, payload manipulation, and chaining to exploit successfully.

The application mimics a production-grade SaaS product and supports manual penetration testing, vulnerability research, and automated scanning. Attackers must exploit vulnerabilities in a realistic multi-step chain — starting with authentication bypass and culminating in internal network access.

## Vulnerabilities (Detailed)

### 1. SQLi – Login Page
**Summary:** The login page performs unsafe SQL concatenation when handling the `username` parameter. Detection triggers when a single quote `'` is used in the input.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to `/auth/login` and enter a username containing a single quote `'`. Observe an error or database warning.  
2. Bypass detection by using a **double URL-encoded single quote** to break the query:  
   ```
   %2527 UNION SELECT NULL--+
   ```
3. You will gain unauthorized access or leak data.

### 2. SQLi (Blind – Time-Based)
**Summary:** The `filter` parameter in the `/restaurants` endpoint is vulnerable to blind time-based SQL injection. No data is directly returned, but the server response time indicates conditional logic execution.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Send a GET request to `/restaurants?filter=1' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--+`
2. Observe the server response is delayed by ~5 seconds.

### 3. Reflected XSS – Search Page
**Summary:** The search feature does not sanitize input properly, allowing script injection.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Visit `/search?q=<math href=javascript:alert(1)>`
2. Observe JavaScript execution
**PoC screenshot or unlisted video URL:**  
> **Note:** SOON WILL BE PRESENTED

---

### 4. DOM-Based XSS – Feedback Preview
**Summary:** The feedback preview page reads the `location.hash` from the URL and injects it into the DOM using `innerHTML`. This enables DOM-based XSS.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Visit the feedback preview page:  
   ```
   /feedback/preview#/feedback=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
   ```
2. The payload executes directly in the victim’s browser.

### 5. SSTI – Template Evaluation
**Summary:** Template rendering uses unsanitized user input, enabling code execution.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Submit payload: `{{ ''.join(['__cla','ss__']) }}`
2. Observe backend code execution

### 6. SSTI – Remote Code Execution
**Summary:** Exploit the template rendering engine to achieve remote code execution.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Submit payload: `{{ (7).__pow__(2) }}`
2. Achieve code execution on the server
